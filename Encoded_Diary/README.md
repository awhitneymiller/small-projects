# Encoded Diary

A coded diary that can only be understood by deciphering the encoded text using a simple cipher.

## Description

This project allows you to write and store entries in a coded form. Each entry is encoded using a basic cipher known as the Caesar cipher. This means that the text of the diary is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the ASCII character set, making it unreadable without deciphering.

When viewing previous entries, the program deciphers the encoded text using the reverse process of the cipher, revealing the original content. You can also write new entries, which are encoded and stored in the diary file.

Anyone opening the diary file itself will just find a jumble of characters.
